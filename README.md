## Coding for fun.

Currently learning more about Python. Have been experimenting with:
  
* Tkinter GUI
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib
* Pillow (PIL)
* Turtle

Also trying some stuff in GNU Octave.

Python code for a Numworks calculator can also be found here.

and on the Numworks site, most scripts can be emulated right there

This device has a Python coding app which implements a version of MicroPython.
