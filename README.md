## Coding for fun.

### CPython

Currently learning more about Python. Have been experimenting with:
  
* Tkinter GUI
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib
* Pillow (PIL)
* Turtle

#### A lot of shorter Python projects can be found here:

#### Some bigger projects:

### Numworks calculator

Python code for a Numworks calculator can be found here:

and also on the Numworks site, most scripts can be emulated right there:

This device has a Python coding app which implements a version of MicroPython.

Also trying some stuff in GNU Octave now and then:
